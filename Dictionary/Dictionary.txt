1. Open hashing - closed addressing
2. Closed hashing - open addresing

searching techniques
is linear search or binary search
0(n) - linear, n is the number of data
O(logn) - binary



A technique that has a constant time, which is hashing
where we use hash table or hash function


Hash function, we calculate some hash value, 
that address we can store that key



Collission means, when the hash value 
appears more than one time. 

Hash function, division, folding method, mid square method, module multiplation method


to resolve collisions

you cannot remove collision, you can only minimize 

for open hashing
- its called chaining method. 

for closed hashing 
- linear probing
- Quadratic probing
- Double hashing




Hash function
division method

H(k) = k % M where m is the size of the array


* probing means is synonym searching, 
search the free place


insert Ki at first free location from (u + i) % m, where i = 0 to (m-1)
u is the location'
