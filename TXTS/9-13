Sentinel Values

 Using a sentinel value (-1 trick)

 * For finding min/max in non-empty collections, 
 not using sentinel value is safe and standard,


 * For search problems (like cheapest available room, Room with ID), where some elements are disqualified, a sentinel is more convenient, since the first few items may not be valid;
