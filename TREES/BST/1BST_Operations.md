| Find in-order predecessor        | Largest node smaller than given node; useful for deletion      |
| Find in-order successor          | Smallest node larger than given node; useful for deletion      |
| Height of the tree               | Compute tree height; useful for balance checks                 |
| Count nodes                      | Count total nodes in the tree                                  |
| Count leaves                     | Count nodes with no children                                   |
| Count internal nodes             | Count nodes with at least one child                            |
| Verify BST property              | Ensure tree maintains BST rules                                |
